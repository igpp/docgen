			Cassini magnetic-field 1 minute averages for th
			e year 2012 in RTN coordinates. RTN coordinates consist of R (radial component,
			Sun to the spacecraft), T (tangential component, parallel to the Solar Equatoria
			l plane and perpendicular to R), and N (normal component, completes right handed
			set). These MAG data were processed (calibrated, rotated into RTN coordinates,
			and averaged) by the Cassini MAG team at Imperial College. They were provided to
			PDS by the MAG team Co-I at UCLA. Trajectory and the number of points in the av
			erage were added at the PDS/PPI node. For more information on this and previous
			versions, please refer to the PDS catalog file for this data set (CO_MAG_CAL_1MI
			N_DS.CAT).
